          "sources": [3, 5],
          "answer": "The primary factors were retail industry benchmarking data, advanced analytics platform, and proven retail compensation expertise. Mercer had much more comprehensive retail compensation data - they could benchmark our roles against 200+ retail companies versus your 50. Their analytics platform could model the impact of different compensation strategies on retention and performance, and they understood the unique challenges of retail compensation including seasonal workers, store management, and omnichannel operations.",
          "evidence": "We needed a partner who understood the complexity of retail compensation - from hourly store associates to district managers to corporate roles. Mercer's retail practice had worked with major retailers on similar total rewards transformations and they had proprietary data on retail compensation trends, including the impact of minimum wage changes and labor market dynamics."

          "sources": [5, 6],
          "answer": "Pricing was comparable - both proposals were within the same range. Service capability strongly favored Mercer due to their retail benchmarking data and analytics platform. Product fit was better with Mercer because their methodology was specifically designed for retail total rewards challenges.",
          "evidence": "Your pricing was competitive, which we appreciated. However, Mercer's retail practice had developed total rewards frameworks specifically for retail companies, including seasonal workforce management, store-level incentive design, and omnichannel compensation strategies. Their approach felt purpose-built for our industry challenges."

          "sources": [5, 6],
          "answer": "The main gaps were in retail benchmarking data and understanding of retail-specific compensation challenges. Your team approached this as a general total rewards project rather than understanding the unique challenges of retail compensation including seasonal fluctuations, high turnover, and diverse workforce needs.",
          "evidence": "We operate stores across different markets with varying labor costs, seasonal staffing needs, and diverse workforce demographics. Your proposal didn't address how to design compensation programs for seasonal workers, how to benchmark store management roles across different market sizes, or how to integrate e-commerce and store compensation strategies."

          "evidence": "They showed us benchmarking data that included seasonal variations, geographic differences, and performance-based pay structures specific to retail. They understood that our compensation strategy needed to address high turnover, seasonal hiring, and the challenge of competing for talent in a tight labor market."

          "sources": [6, 7],
          "answer": "Yes, their retail workforce analytics model was impressive. It could predict turnover risk, model the ROI of different compensation strategies, and optimize pay structures for different store formats and markets. This gave us a data-driven approach to retail compensation design.",
          "evidence": "This analytics capability was crucial for us. They could model how different pay strategies would impact turnover in different markets, predict the cost-benefit of various incentive programs, and help us optimize our compensation spend for maximum retention and performance impact. This kind of retail-specific analytics was something we couldn't get elsewhere."

Communication was clear and professional, Jennifer and her team were responsive, and they understood our general compensation needs. The gap was more in retail industry expertise and benchmarking data than relationship quality.",
          "evidence": "Your team was professional and clearly understood total rewards principles. The relationship management was good - we felt like you were genuinely committed to our success. The challenge was around understanding the specific complexities of retail compensation and having access to comprehensive retail benchmarking data."

But when we talked about seasonal workforce compensation, store management incentives, and retail-specific benchmarking, it felt like we were having to educate your team about the unique aspects of retail compensation."

          "answer": "The initial compensation assessment workshop was excellent and helped clarify our total rewards priorities. The final presentation was professional but lacked retail industry context and benchmarking depth.",
          "evidence": "That first workshop was really valuable - it helped us understand our current compensation challenges and align on priorities. But the final proposal felt generic and didn't address our unique challenges around retail workforce management and market-specific compensation strategies."

The compensation expertise is there - it's about building the retail industry specialization and data capabilities."
