          "answer": "The decisive factors were McKinsey's proven change management methodology, deeper manufacturing industry expertise, and their ability to handle the scale and complexity of our transformation.",
          "evidence": "McKinsey had led similar transformations at three major manufacturing companies in our sector. Their change management approach was more comprehensive, and they had the resources to handle our 15,000-employee transformation across multiple sites."

          "evidence": "Your pricing was significantly more attractive, which we appreciated. But McKinsey's manufacturing practice had deeper operational expertise and their transformation methodology had been proven at companies our size and complexity."

          "evidence": "While your organizational strategy capabilities were strong, we needed someone who had managed transformations across multiple manufacturing sites with union workforces. The operational complexity required deeper manufacturing expertise."

          "evidence": "If you could add manufacturing operations experts to your team, or partner with firms that have that expertise, you'd be much more competitive for large manufacturing transformations."
