Company: Industrial Solutions Corp

==================================================

Thank you for taking the time to speak with me, James. This conversation is confidential and will help us improve our future engagements. To recap, we worked with Industrial Solutions Corp over a six-month period on a comprehensive organizational transformation and workforce optimization initiative, targeting implementation across your 15,000-employee organization. We understand you've selected McKinsey & Company for this engagement. Could you share the top factors that influenced your decision? McKinsey had led similar transformations at three major manufacturing companies in our sector. Their change management approach was more comprehensive, and they had the resources to handle our 15,000-employee transformation across multiple sites. The scale and complexity required their level of expertise. How did our proposal compare to McKinsey's in terms of pricing, service capability, and product fit? Your pricing was significantly more attractive, which we appreciated - about 20% lower than McKinsey. But McKinsey's manufacturing practice had deeper operational expertise and their transformation methodology had been proven at companies our size and complexity. The service capability gap was significant. Were there any specific gaps where our offering didn't meet your expectations? While your organizational strategy capabilities were strong, we needed someone who had managed transformations across multiple manufacturing sites with union workforces. The operational complexity required deeper manufacturing expertise than what we saw in your proposal. What aspects of McKinsey's offering stood out to your team? They had a dedicated manufacturing practice with former plant managers and operations executives. Their transformation approach included detailed operational redesign, not just organizational structure changes. The depth of manufacturing knowledge was impressive. Did McKinsey offer anything innovative that tipped the scales? The digital accelerator was brilliant - it integrated our organizational transformation with our Industry 4.0 initiatives. This created efficiencies and cost savings that made the higher price worthwhile. We couldn't achieve those synergies separately. How would you describe your experience working with our team? Jennifer and her team were outstanding to work with. Communication was clear, they were always available, and they understood our culture well. The gap was in deep manufacturing operations knowledge, but the relationship was excellent. Were there moments where our approach stood out positively or negatively? Your organizational assessment was probably the most comprehensive we've seen. But when we got into manufacturing operations and workflow redesign, the recommendations felt more generic. The organizational work was top-notch though. How was the chemistry and collaboration between our teams? The collaboration was seamless across all levels of our organization. Your team showed respect for our manufacturing culture and built good relationships with our plant leadership. That executive workshop was incredibly valuable - it got our leadership team aligned on the transformation vision. Despite this decision, do you see opportunities to work together in the future? We're planning a major leadership development initiative next year, and your organizational strategy capabilities would be ideal for that. We'd definitely want to work with you on the right project. Your strengths would be perfect for that type of engagement. What would you need to see from us to feel more confident choosing us for a future project? If you could add manufacturing operations experts to your team, or partner with firms that have that expertise, you'd be much more competitive for large manufacturing transformations. The operational depth is what we needed. Thank you for your time and candid feedback, James. This has been incredibly valuable for understanding how we can improve.
