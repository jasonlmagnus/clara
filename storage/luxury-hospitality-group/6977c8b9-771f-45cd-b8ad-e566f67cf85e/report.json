          "text": "Could you share the top factors influencing your decision?",
          "sources": [3, 5],
          "answer": "The primary factors were technology platform integration capabilities, cost structure, and proven hospitality industry experience. PwC had a much stronger technology backbone and their pricing was significantly more competitive - about 25% lower than your proposal. They also brought specific case studies from luxury hotel chains that were directly relevant to our challenges.",
          "evidence": "We needed a partner who could seamlessly integrate with our existing property management systems and guest experience platforms. PwC demonstrated they had worked with three major luxury hotel groups on similar talent management transformations, and their technology integration approach was much more sophisticated than what we saw from Korn Ferry."

          "sources": [5, 6],
          "answer": "Pricing was definitely a challenge - you were about 25% higher than PwC, which was significant for our budget. Service capability favored PwC because of their technology integration expertise and hospitality industry depth. Product fit was neutral - both approaches could work, but PwC's was more tailored to hospitality operations.",
          "evidence": "Your pricing included a lot of premium consulting hours that we weren't sure we needed. PwC's approach was more streamlined and focused specifically on hospitality talent management challenges. They had pre-built modules for things like seasonal staffing, guest service excellence, and multi-property coordination that would have saved us months of customization."

          "sources": [5, 6],
          "answer": "The main gaps were in technology integration capabilities and hospitality-specific expertise. Your team seemed to approach this as a general talent management project rather than understanding the unique challenges of luxury hospitality operations.",
          "evidence": "We operate 24/7 across multiple time zones with highly seasonal staffing needs and very specific guest service standards. PwC understood that our talent management system needed to handle things like concierge succession planning, seasonal F&B staffing models, and guest preference tracking. Your proposal felt more generic and would have required significant customization."

          "answer": "Their integrated technology platform was impressive - it connected recruitment, onboarding, performance management, and succession planning in one system that could interface with our property management systems. They also had hospitality-specific competency models and assessment tools.",
          "evidence": "They showed us how their system could track guest service scores alongside employee performance data, and how it could automatically flag high-potential staff for advancement based on both operational metrics and guest feedback. This kind of hospitality-specific functionality was exactly what we needed."

          "sources": [6, 7],
          "answer": "Yes, their predictive analytics for seasonal staffing was brilliant. The system could forecast staffing needs based on booking patterns, historical guest service data, and local events, then automatically trigger recruitment and training workflows.",
          "evidence": "This was a game-changer for us. Managing seasonal fluctuations is one of our biggest operational challenges, and their system could predict when we'd need to start recruiting for summer season based on booking trends and automatically begin the process. It would save us weeks of manual planning and ensure we're never understaffed during peak periods."

          "evidence": "The leadership assessment process you proposed was incredibly thorough and would have been perfect for developing our management team. But when we started discussing things like seasonal workforce planning and guest service integration, it felt like we were having to educate your team about hospitality operations."

          "answer": "The initial stakeholder workshop was exceptional - it really helped us clarify what we needed from a talent management transformation. The final presentation was professional but felt generic for our industry.",
          "evidence": "That first workshop where you brought together all our department heads was incredibly valuable. It helped us get aligned on priorities across properties. But the final proposal presentation used a lot of generic examples that didn't resonate with our hospitality-specific challenges."

          "answer": "Deeper hospitality industry expertise, stronger technology integration capabilities, and more competitive pricing for hospitality-specific solutions. If you could partner with hospitality technology specialists or hire someone with luxury hotel operations experience, that would make a huge difference.",
          "evidence": "We'd love to see you develop hospitality-specific competency models, assessment tools, and maybe even partner with property management system providers. The relationship and cultural expertise is already there - it's really about building the industry-specific capabilities."
