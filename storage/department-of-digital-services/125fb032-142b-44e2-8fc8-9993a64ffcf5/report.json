          "text": "Could you share the top factors influencing your decision?",
          "sources": [3, 5],
          "answer": "The primary factors were security clearance depth, federal contracting experience, and proven track record with large-scale government digital transformations. Accenture Federal had the security clearances we needed - over 200 cleared consultants versus your 15. They also had established relationships with our oversight agencies and understood the complexity of federal procurement and compliance requirements.",
          "evidence": "We needed a partner who could navigate the federal environment from day one. Accenture Federal's team included former federal CIOs and their project managers had Top Secret clearances. They understood FISMA compliance, FedRAMP requirements, and how to work within federal budget cycles and oversight structures."

          "note": "Pricing: Positive, Service capability: Negative, Product fit: Negative",
          "sources": [5, 6],
          "answer": "Pricing favored Korn Ferry - you were about 20% lower than Accenture Federal. However, service capability strongly favored Accenture due to their security clearances and federal expertise. Product fit was better with Accenture because their methodology was designed specifically for federal digital transformations.",
          "evidence": "Your pricing was more competitive, which was important given our budget constraints. But Accenture Federal's federal practice had developed transformation frameworks specifically for government agencies, including compliance integration, stakeholder management across multiple oversight bodies, and phased implementation approaches that work within federal constraints."

          "sources": [5, 6],
          "answer": "The main gaps were in security clearances, federal compliance expertise, and understanding of government organizational dynamics. Your team approached this as a general digital transformation rather than understanding the unique challenges of federal agencies.",
          "evidence": "We operate under strict security requirements, multiple oversight bodies, and complex stakeholder environments. Your proposal didn't address how to manage transformation while maintaining FISMA compliance, how to navigate OMB oversight, or how to work within federal hiring and procurement constraints."

          "answer": "Their federal expertise was exceptional - they had former government executives, established relationships with oversight agencies, and deep understanding of federal compliance requirements. They also had proven experience with similar transformations at other federal agencies.",
          "evidence": "They showed us case studies from three other federal agencies that had undergone similar digital transformations. They understood that our success would be measured not just on technical outcomes, but on compliance, stakeholder satisfaction, and ability to navigate the federal oversight environment."

          "sources": [6, 7],
          "answer": "Yes, their federal compliance integration approach was brilliant. They had developed a methodology that embedded compliance and oversight requirements into every phase of the transformation, ensuring we could maintain operations while meeting all federal requirements.",
          "evidence": "This compliance-first approach was crucial for us. They could ensure that our digital transformation would pass OMB reviews, GAO audits, and congressional oversight while still delivering the modernization we needed. This kind of federal-specific expertise was something we couldn't get elsewhere."

Communication was clear and professional, Patricia and her team were responsive, and they understood our general transformation needs. The gap was more in federal expertise and security clearance requirements than relationship quality.",
          "evidence": "Your team was professional and clearly understood organizational transformation principles. The relationship management was good - we felt like you were genuinely committed to our success. The challenge was around understanding the unique constraints and requirements of federal agencies."

But when we talked about FISMA compliance, security clearance requirements, and federal oversight processes, it felt like we were having to educate your team about the federal environment."

          "answer": "The initial transformation assessment workshop was excellent and helped clarify our modernization priorities. The final presentation was professional but lacked federal context and compliance considerations.",
          "evidence": "That first workshop was really valuable - it helped us understand our current state and align on transformation goals. But the final proposal felt generic and didn't address our unique challenges around federal oversight, security requirements, and compliance constraints."

          "evidence": "The transformation methodology was solid - it's really about building the federal-specific expertise and security clearance capabilities. We'd also be interested in discussing state and local government work where your approach might be a better fit."

          "answer": "Security clearances for your team, federal compliance expertise, and relationships with government oversight agencies. If you could partner with cleared consultants or hire former federal executives, that would make a significant difference.",
          "evidence": "We'd need to see you develop a cleared workforce, build expertise in federal compliance frameworks, and establish relationships with OMB, GAO, and other oversight bodies. The organizational transformation expertise is there - it's about building the federal specialization."
