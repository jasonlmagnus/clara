          "answer": "The primary factors were regulatory expertise, board-level relationships, and proven track record in financial services risk management. Spencer Stuart demonstrated deeper knowledge of current regulatory requirements and had existing relationships with several board members.",
          "evidence": "We needed someone who understood the evolving regulatory landscape, particularly around Basel III and stress testing requirements. Spencer Stuart's candidate pool included several executives with direct regulatory experience, and their consultant had worked with three of our board members previously."

          "sources": [5, 6],
          "answer": "Pricing was competitive and actually lower than Spencer Stuart. Service capability was the main differentiator - they had a dedicated financial services practice with deeper regulatory expertise. Product fit was neutral, both firms offered comprehensive search processes.",
          "evidence": "Your pricing was about 15% lower, which we appreciated. However, Spencer Stuart's financial services practice head had direct experience with similar CRO searches at three major banks. Their assessment methodology specifically included regulatory scenario testing, which was crucial for this role."

          "sources": [5, 6],
          "answer": "The main gap was in regulatory expertise and the depth of the candidate pool for senior risk management roles. We also needed stronger board-level references for this type of appointment.",
          "evidence": "We felt your team, while excellent, didn't have the same depth of regulatory knowledge that we needed for this critical role. The candidate profiles you presented were strong operationally but lacked the regulatory background we required."

          "evidence": "They brought candidates who had actually worked at the Fed and OCC, which was invaluable. Their consultant also had direct relationships with key regulators, which helped us understand what regulators would be looking for in our next CRO."

          "answer": "Yes, they offered a regulatory readiness assessment as part of the search process, which helped us understand gaps in our current risk management structure before making the hire.",
          "evidence": "The regulatory readiness assessment was brilliant - it helped us identify specific areas where our new CRO would need to focus immediately. This wasn't just about finding a candidate, but about understanding our organizational needs better."
