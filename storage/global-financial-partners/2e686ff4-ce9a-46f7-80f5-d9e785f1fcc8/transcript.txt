==================================================

Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today, Rebecca. As mentioned, this conversation is confidential and will be used solely to help us improve future engagements. Any recording will be deleted once the transcript is complete and your feedback is extremely valuable. Just to recap, we engaged with Global Financial Partners over a four-month period to conduct an executive search for your Chief Risk Officer position, with a target start date in Q4 2025. We understand that you've chosen Spencer Stuart for this engagement and would like to learn more about that decision.

Could you share the top factors that influenced your decision? We needed someone who understood the evolving regulatory landscape, particularly around Basel III and stress testing requirements. Spencer Stuart's candidate pool included several executives with direct regulatory experience, and their consultant had worked with three of our board members previously. The regulatory expertise was really the deciding factor for us.

How did our proposal compare to Spencer Stuart in terms of pricing, service capability, and product fit? Your pricing was about 15% lower, which we appreciated. However, Spencer Stuart's financial services practice head had direct experience with similar CRO searches at three major banks. Their assessment methodology specifically included regulatory scenario testing, which was crucial for this role. Both firms offered comprehensive search processes, so product fit was fairly neutral.

Were there any specific gaps or areas where our offering didn't meet your expectations? We felt your team, while excellent, didn't have the same depth of regulatory knowledge that we needed for this critical role. The candidate profiles you presented were strong operationally but lacked the regulatory background we required. We really needed someone who could hit the ground running on regulatory compliance.

What aspects of Spencer Stuart's offering stood out to your team? They brought candidates who had actually worked at the Fed and OCC, which was invaluable. Their consultant also had direct relationships with key regulators, which helped us understand what regulators would be looking for in our next CRO. That level of regulatory insight was something we couldn't get elsewhere.

Did Spencer Stuart offer anything innovative or particularly compelling that tipped the scales? The regulatory readiness assessment was brilliant - it helped us identify specific areas where our new CRO would need to focus immediately. This wasn't just about finding a candidate, but about understanding our organizational needs better. That added value really differentiated them.

How would you describe your experience working with our team? Sarah and her team were fantastic to work with. They were always available, provided regular updates, and clearly understood our culture and values. The only area for improvement would be deeper regulatory knowledge. The communication and responsiveness were excellent throughout.

Were there moments in the process where our approach stood out, either positively or negatively? Your cultural fit assessment was probably the best we've seen. You really understood our values and what type of leader would succeed here. But when we got into regulatory discussions, we felt we needed more specialized expertise. That first workshop where you brought together all our stakeholders was incredibly valuable though.

How would you describe the chemistry and collaboration between your team and ours? The collaboration was seamless. Your team worked well with our CHRO, our current CRO, and even the board members who were involved. Everyone felt comfortable and engaged in the process. The chemistry was definitely there.

Despite this decision, do you see potential opportunities for us to work together in the future? We're looking at a new Chief Marketing Officer and Chief Technology Officer in the next 12 months. For those roles, your strengths would be perfect. We'd definitely want to work with you again. Your cultural assessment capabilities and overall approach were impressive.

What would you need to see from us to feel more confident in choosing us for a future project? If you could add someone with deep regulatory experience to your financial services team, or partner with regulatory specialists, that would make you much more competitive for senior risk and compliance roles. That's really the main gap we saw.

Thank you so much for your time and candid feedback, Rebecca. This has been incredibly valuable for us.
