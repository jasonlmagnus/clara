          "text": "Could you share the top factors influencing your decision?",
          "sources": [3, 5],
          "answer": "The primary factors were pharmaceutical board relationships, regulatory expertise, and proven experience with pharma CEO succession planning. Egon Zehnder had existing relationships with four of our board members and their pharmaceutical practice head had been involved in three major pharma CEO transitions in the past two years.",
          "evidence": "We needed a partner who understood the unique challenges of pharmaceutical leadership, particularly around regulatory oversight and pipeline management. Egon Zehnder's consultant had worked directly with our board chair at his previous company and understood our specific governance challenges around drug development oversight."

          "note": "Pricing: Neutral, Service capability: Negative, Product fit: Negative",
          "sources": [5, 6],
          "answer": "Pricing was comparable - both proposals were within 10% of each other. Service capability strongly favored Egon Zehnder due to their pharmaceutical board network and regulatory expertise. Product fit was better with Egon Zehnder because their board effectiveness methodology was specifically designed for pharmaceutical companies.",
          "evidence": "Your pricing was actually slightly lower, which we appreciated. However, Egon Zehnder's pharmaceutical practice had developed board assessment tools that included FDA regulatory competencies, pipeline oversight capabilities, and pharma-specific governance frameworks. Their approach felt purpose-built for our industry challenges."

          "sources": [5, 6],
          "answer": "The main gaps were in pharmaceutical regulatory expertise and board-level relationships within the pharma industry. Your team approached this as a general board effectiveness project rather than understanding the unique governance challenges in pharmaceutical companies.",
          "evidence": "We operate in a highly regulated environment where board oversight of drug development, FDA interactions, and clinical trial governance are critical. Your proposal didn't address how board members would be assessed on their ability to oversee these pharma-specific functions, and we weren't confident your team understood the regulatory complexity."

          "answer": "Their pharmaceutical-specific board assessment methodology was impressive, including competency frameworks for drug development oversight, regulatory compliance, and clinical trial governance. They also had direct relationships with several pharmaceutical board members who could provide peer insights.",
          "evidence": "They showed us assessment tools that evaluated board members on their understanding of FDA processes, ability to oversee clinical trials, and experience with drug commercialization decisions. This kind of pharma-specific expertise was exactly what we needed for our board effectiveness review."

          "sources": [6, 7],
          "answer": "Yes, their pharmaceutical board peer network was exceptional. They could facilitate confidential discussions with board chairs from other major pharma companies about governance best practices and succession planning approaches.",
          "evidence": "This peer network access was invaluable. They arranged for our board chair to have confidential conversations with board chairs from three other major pharmaceutical companies about CEO succession planning and board oversight of pipeline decisions. This kind of industry-specific peer learning was something we couldn't get elsewhere."

Communication was excellent, Robert and his team were highly responsive, and they demonstrated good understanding of our general governance needs. The gap was more in pharmaceutical industry expertise than relationship quality.",

          "evidence": "The general board effectiveness assessment you proposed was probably the most thorough we'd seen. But when we started talking about things like clinical trial oversight, FDA advisory committee preparation, and pipeline risk assessment, it felt like we were having to educate your team about pharmaceutical governance."

          "answer": "The initial board assessment workshop was outstanding and really helped clarify our governance priorities. The final presentation was professional but lacked pharmaceutical industry context.",
          "evidence": "That first workshop with our board members was incredibly valuable - it helped us identify specific areas where we needed to strengthen our oversight capabilities. But the final proposal felt generic and didn't address our unique challenges around drug development governance."

          "evidence": "We're looking at board effectiveness for our subsidiaries and potentially some leadership development work where your governance expertise would be ideal. The core methodology was strong - it's really about building the pharma-specific knowledge."

If you could partner with former pharma executives or FDA officials, that would make a significant difference.",
          "evidence": "We'd love to see you develop pharma-specific board assessment tools, maybe partner with former pharma CEOs or FDA commissioners, and build case studies from pharmaceutical board effectiveness work. The relationship and governance expertise is already there."
