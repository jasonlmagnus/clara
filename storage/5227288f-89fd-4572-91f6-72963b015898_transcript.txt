==================================================


        Interviewer: Thank you for taking the time to speak with us today. Could you share the top factors that influenced your decision?
        
        Client: Well, the main factors were really around implementation confidence and prior sector experience. The chosen provider had more relevant case studies in our industry, and their delivery lead had deep retail experience which made us feel more assured about the project.
        
        Interviewer: How did our proposal compare to the chosen provider in terms of pricing, service capability, and product fit?
        
        Client: In terms of pricing, it was pretty neutral overall. Both proposals were similar in cost, though yours offered more flexible payment terms which we appreciated. For service capability, it was slightly less compelling - the other provider had a named delivery lead with experience that matched our industry which tipped the balance. But in terms of product fit, it was actually positive. Your product felt more modern and adaptable, and we were particularly impressed with the user interface.
        
        Interviewer: Were there any specific gaps where our offering didn't meet expectations?
        
        Client: Integration with our payroll systems was a concern as yours would have required custom work. We were also unsure about the level of post-implementation support compared to the competitor.
