          "text": "Could you share the top factors influencing your decision?",
          "sources": [3, 5],
          "answer": "The primary factors were energy industry expertise, technology implementation capabilities, and comprehensive workforce reskilling programs. Deloitte had much deeper experience with energy sector digital transformations - they had led similar workforce transformations at three major renewable energy companies. Their technology integration approach was more sophisticated, and they understood the unique challenges of transitioning traditional energy workers to renewable technologies.",
          "evidence": "We needed a partner who understood both the technical aspects of renewable energy and the human side of workforce transformation. Deloitte's energy practice had developed reskilling programs specifically for oil and gas workers transitioning to renewable energy, and their technology implementation team had experience with the specific systems and processes used in our industry."

          "sources": [5, 6],
          "answer": "Pricing was comparable - both proposals were within 10% of each other. Service capability strongly favored Deloitte due to their energy industry expertise and technology implementation experience. Product fit was better with Deloitte because their methodology was specifically designed for energy sector workforce transformations.",
          "evidence": "Your pricing was competitive, which we appreciated. However, Deloitte's energy practice had developed workforce transformation frameworks specifically for renewable energy companies, including technical reskilling programs, change management approaches for energy workers, and technology integration strategies that work within energy sector constraints."

          "sources": [5, 6],
          "answer": "The main gaps were in energy industry expertise and understanding of renewable energy technology requirements. Your team approached this as a general workforce transformation rather than understanding the unique challenges of transitioning workers from traditional energy to renewable technologies.",
          "evidence": "We operate in a highly technical environment where workers need to understand complex renewable energy systems, safety protocols specific to our industry, and emerging technologies like energy storage and smart grid integration. Your proposal didn't address how to reskill workers on these specific technologies or how to manage the cultural shift from traditional energy to renewable energy."

They also had proven reskilling programs that could transition traditional energy workers to renewable technologies.",
          "evidence": "They showed us case studies from wind and solar companies where they had successfully reskilled oil and gas workers for renewable energy roles. They understood that our transformation wasn't just about new processes, but about helping our workforce develop entirely new technical competencies while maintaining safety standards."

          "sources": [6, 7],
          "answer": "Yes, their renewable energy reskilling academy was brilliant. They had developed a comprehensive training program that could transition traditional energy workers to renewable technologies, including hands-on technical training, safety certification, and career pathway planning.",
          "evidence": "This reskilling academy was exactly what we needed. They could take our existing workforce and provide them with the technical skills needed for renewable energy operations, while also helping them understand career progression opportunities in the renewable sector. This kind of industry-specific workforce development was something we couldn't get elsewhere."

Communication was clear and professional, Michael and his team were responsive, and they understood our general workforce transformation needs. The gap was more in energy industry expertise and technical understanding than relationship quality.",

The relationship management was good - we felt like you were genuinely committed to our success. The challenge was around understanding the specific technical requirements and industry dynamics of renewable energy."

          "answer": "The initial workforce assessment workshop was excellent and helped clarify our transformation priorities. The final presentation was professional but lacked energy industry context and technical depth.",
          "evidence": "That first workshop was really valuable - it helped us understand our current workforce capabilities and align on transformation goals. But the final proposal felt generic and didn't address our unique challenges around technical reskilling and renewable energy expertise development."
