          "text": "Could you share the top factors influencing your decision?",
          "sources": [3, 5],
          "answer": "The primary factors were Silicon Valley network depth, speed of execution, and proven track record with high-growth tech companies. Russell Reynolds had placed VPs of Engineering at three unicorn startups in the past 18 months, and their turnaround time was significantly faster - they promised to present candidates within 3 weeks versus our 6-week timeline.",
          "evidence": "We're in a hyper-competitive market for engineering talent, and speed is critical. Russell Reynolds' consultant had direct relationships with engineering leaders at companies like Stripe, Airbnb, and other unicorns. They could reach passive candidates that we couldn't access through our network, and their Silicon Valley presence meant they understood the compensation expectations and cultural fit requirements for our stage of growth."

          "sources": [5, 6],
          "answer": "Pricing was comparable - both proposals were within the same range for executive search. Service capability strongly favored Russell Reynolds due to their Silicon Valley network and tech startup expertise. Product fit was better with Russell Reynolds because their process was designed for fast-moving tech companies.",
          "evidence": "Your pricing was actually slightly more competitive, which we appreciated. However, Russell Reynolds' technology practice had developed search methodologies specifically for high-growth startups, including rapid candidate assessment, equity compensation modeling, and cultural fit evaluation for scaling teams. Their approach felt purpose-built for our stage and industry."

          "sources": [5, 6],
          "answer": "The main gaps were in Silicon Valley network depth and understanding of startup culture and compensation structures. Your team approached this as a traditional executive search rather than understanding the unique challenges of recruiting senior engineering talent for a scaling startup.",
          "evidence": "We needed someone who understood equity compensation, the importance of technical leadership in a startup environment, and the cultural nuances of recruiting from big tech companies to startups. Your proposal didn't address how you'd evaluate candidates' ability to scale engineering teams from 20 to 200 people, or their experience with the technical challenges we face."

          "sources": [5],
          "answer": "Their Silicon Valley network was exceptional - they had direct relationships with engineering leaders at all the major tech companies and unicorn startups. They also had proprietary data on compensation trends and a deep understanding of what motivates senior engineers to leave big tech for startups.",
          "evidence": "They showed us their network map of engineering leaders in Silicon Valley and their track record of successful placements. They understood that our VP of Engineering would need to be someone who could attract other senior engineers, and they had insights into what compensation packages and equity structures would be competitive."

          "sources": [6, 7],
          "answer": "Yes, their technical assessment process was impressive. They had developed a methodology for evaluating engineering leaders that included technical depth, team scaling experience, and cultural fit for startup environments. They also offered to facilitate technical interviews with our existing engineering team.",
          "evidence": "This technical assessment was crucial for us. They could evaluate candidates not just on leadership skills but on their actual technical competence and ability to make architectural decisions. They also understood that our engineering team needed to feel confident in the new VP's technical abilities, so they built that validation into their process."

          "evidence": "Your team was professional and clearly understood executive search principles. The relationship management was good - we felt like you were invested in finding the right candidate. The challenge was more around understanding the specific nuances of recruiting senior engineering talent in Silicon Valley."

          "evidence": "The leadership assessment framework you proposed was comprehensive. But when we talked about evaluating candidates' experience with microservices architecture, team scaling from startup to growth stage, and technical decision-making under rapid growth constraints, it felt like we were having to educate your team about engineering leadership."

          "answer": "The initial stakeholder alignment session was excellent and helped clarify our requirements for the VP of Engineering role. The final presentation was professional but lacked tech industry context and startup-specific insights.",
          "evidence": "That first workshop was really valuable - it helped us get aligned on what we needed in a VP of Engineering beyond just the job description. But the final proposal felt generic and didn't address our unique challenges around scaling engineering teams in a high-growth startup environment."

          "evidence": "We're looking at a Chief Marketing Officer and potentially a Chief Revenue Officer where your executive search expertise would be ideal. The core methodology was strong - it's really about building the tech industry network and startup expertise."

          "answer": "Stronger Silicon Valley network, deeper understanding of tech startup culture and compensation structures, and technical assessment capabilities for engineering roles. If you could partner with former tech executives or hire someone with startup engineering leadership experience, that would make a significant difference.",
          "evidence": "We'd love to see you build relationships with engineering leaders at major tech companies, develop expertise in equity compensation modeling, and create assessment frameworks specifically for technical leadership roles. The executive search fundamentals are there - it's about building the tech industry specialization."
