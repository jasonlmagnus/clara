==================================================

Hi Charlotte, thank you for taking the time to speak with me. As mentioned, this conversation is confidential and will be used solely to help us improve future engagements. Any recording will be deleted once the transit is complete and your feedback is extremely valuable and we appreciate your honesty. Just to recap, we engaged with Magnus over a three month period to propose an HR transformation and workforce management solution with a target launch in Q3 2025. We understand that you've chosen another provider and would like to learn more about that decision. Could you share the top factors influencing your decision? We prioritised implementation confidence, prior sector experience and alignment with our leadership team and the chosen provider had more relevant case studies and a delivery lead with deep retail experience which made us feel more assured. How did our proposal compare to the chosen provider in terms of pricing, service capability and product fit alignment? For pricing, it was neutral overall. Both proposals were similar in cost, though yours offered more flexible payment terms which we appreciated. Service capacity was slightly less compelling. The other provider had a named delivery lead with experience that matched our industry which tipped the balance. And in terms of product fit alignment, it was positive. Your product felt more modern and adaptable and we were particularly impressed with the user interface. And were there any specific gaps or areas where our offering didn't meet your expectations? Integration with our payroll systems was a concern as yours would have required custom work. We were also unsure about the level of post implementation support compared to the competitor. And what aspects of the chosen provider's offering stood out to you and your team? They offered highly relevant references in our industry and came across as experts in change management. Their stakeholder engagement plan was particularly impressive. Did the competitor offer anything innovative or particularly compelling that tipped the scales in their favour? Yes, their analytics package included retail specific dashboards which we found highly valuable and the sale just from having to build them in-house. And during the three month period, how would you describe your experience working with our team? I thought your team had excellent communication, clear, professional throughout the process. You were really responsive, adapted quickly to when we shifted requirements. And in terms of understanding our needs, I thought it was generally good, although there are a few specific details like seasonal hiring which were picked up later than we expected. Were there moments in the process where our approach stood out, either positively or negatively? Your early stage workshops were outstanding and set a great tone. One drawback was the rotation of attendees from your side, which disrupted continuity slightly. Despite this decision, do you see potential opportunities for us to work together again in the future? Definitely. Your team showed strategic thinking and a broader view of transformation. We'd definitely be open to exploring future collaborations, especially around L&D or talent systems. Amazing. Thank you. That's all the questions for today. Thank you for your time.
