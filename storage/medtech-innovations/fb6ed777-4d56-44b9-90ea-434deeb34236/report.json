Their track record with digital health companies was impressive, with case studies from three companies similar to ours."

          "evidence": "Both proposals were within 5% of each other price-wise. However, Heidrick's healthcare practice had developed leadership frameworks specifically for medtech companies, including FDA regulatory leadership and clinical trial management competencies."
