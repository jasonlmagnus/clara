==================================================

Thank you for joining me today, Dr. Martinez. This conversation is confidential and will help us improve our future engagements. Just to recap, we worked with MedTech Innovations over a five-month period to develop a comprehensive leadership development program for your emerging leaders, with a planned launch in Q1 2026. We understand you've selected Heidrick & Struggles for this initiative.

Could you share the top factors that influenced your decision? Heidrick had developed proprietary assessment tools specifically for healthcare leaders, including clinical leadership competencies and regulatory awareness. Their track record with digital health companies was impressive, with case studies from three companies similar to ours. The healthcare specialization was really critical for us.

How did our proposal compare to Heidrick's in terms of pricing, service capability, and product fit? Both proposals were within 5% of each other price-wise. However, Heidrick's healthcare practice had developed leadership frameworks specifically for medtech companies, including FDA regulatory leadership and clinical trial management competencies. That specialized capability made the difference.

Were there any specific gaps where our offering didn't meet your expectations? Your program was excellent for general leadership development, but we needed content around FDA regulations, clinical trial leadership, and managing physician relationships. These are unique to our industry and weren't adequately addressed in your proposal.

What aspects of Heidrick's offering stood out to your team? They offered coaching from former pharma and medtech CEOs, which was invaluable. Their assessment included clinical leadership scenarios and regulatory decision-making simulations that were directly relevant to our challenges. The industry expertise was unmatched.

Did Heidrick offer anything innovative that tipped the scales? The simulation was incredible - it put our leaders through realistic scenarios like FDA advisory committee meetings and clinical trial data reviews. This kind of experiential learning was exactly what we needed and something we couldn't get elsewhere.

How would you describe your experience working with our team? Michael and his team were always responsive and professional. They clearly understood leadership development principles, but when we discussed healthcare-specific challenges, we felt they needed more industry context. The communication was excellent throughout though.

Were there moments where our approach stood out positively or negatively? Your assessment approach was thorough and well-designed. But during the presentation, most examples came from other industries, which made it harder for us to see how it would apply to our unique challenges. The methodology was sound, but the application felt generic.

How was the chemistry and collaboration between our teams? The collaboration was smooth. Your team integrated well with our internal stakeholders and showed genuine interest in understanding our culture and values. Everyone enjoyed working with your team.

Despite this decision, do you see opportunities to work together in the future? If you developed healthcare-specific content or partnered with healthcare experts, we'd definitely consider you for future programs. Your core methodology was strong, and we were impressed with your overall approach.

What would you need to see from us to feel more confident choosing us for a future project? We'd need to see healthcare-specific modules, maybe partnerships with former FDA executives or healthcare CEOs, and proven results with companies like ours. The industry expertise gap was really the main issue.

Thank you for your time and honest feedback, Dr. Martinez. This has been extremely helpful for our team.
